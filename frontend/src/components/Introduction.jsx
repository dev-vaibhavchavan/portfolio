        Hiee , I am vaibhav chavan,a passionate MERN stack developer with a
        strong focus on building full-stack web applications. I've developed
        multiple projects, including a real-time chat and video calling app
        using WebRTC and WebSockets. I'm currently sharpening my problem-solving
        skills through DSA in C++ and actively use tools like GitHub and Postman
        to streamline my workflow. I enjoy crafting responsive UIs using
        Tailwind CSS and Bootstrap, and I'm always eager to learn and take on
        new challenges.
